This is a work in progress! Follow my progress below:

## Description

This work was an exercise in creating API routes as part of the backend of an e-commerce application. Sequelize is a tool for Object Relational Mapping (ORM). It enables developers to easily work with RDMS like MySQL in the Node server environment.

Additionally, we used the concept of async/await to write the code

There is no frontend portion for this so all API endpoint testing was was done in [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

## Installation

- MySQL is required for this app to run, so follow directions outlined [here](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide) for a step-by-step guide depending on your operating system.
- This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) application. It is recommended to use at least v16 (up to v18) for this app to run correctly.

### Dependencies

- [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) is needed and can be installed via npm. Once in your project folder, type the following in your terminal: `npm i sequelize@5.21.7`.
- [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) is needed to connect the app to the MySQL database. Once in your project folder, type the following in your terminal: `npm i mysql2`.
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) is needed to handle environmental variables. Once in your project folder, type the following in your terminal: `npm i dotenv`.

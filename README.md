## Description

- [ ] GIVEN a functional Express.js API
- [x] WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
- [x] THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
- [ ] WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
- [ ] THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
- [ ] WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
- [ ] THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
- [ ] WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
- [ ] THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- [ ] WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
- [ ] THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

## Installation

- MySQL is required for this app to run, so follow directions outlined [here](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide) for a step-by-step guide depending on your operating system.
- This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) application. It is recommended to use at least v16 (up to v18) for this app to run correctly.

### Dependencies

- [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) is needed and can be installed via npm. Once in your project folder, type the following in your terminal: `npm i sequelize@5.21.7`.
- [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) is needed to connect the app to the MySQL database. Once in your project folder, type the following in your terminal: `npm i mysql2`.
